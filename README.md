OAuth / CORS / Services Proof of Concept
=============================

This is where I want to collect the information about this epic journey that I've been undertaking on building SOA on the front and the back end. Hopefully we'll be able to make great use of this.

THE VISION
----------

By having an OAuth2.0 Provider responsible for authentication and authorization we can build rich clientâ„¢ applications that require little to no server side code to interact with a completly distributed SOA of all our data. We use the bearer token provided by OAuth to allow services to talk to one another and then take advantage of CORS to mashup all of our services into a coherent web application.

The Provider
------------

There isn't a lot fancy going on here. We have a basic devise setup that then has a [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper) backed OAuth setup. There are two APIs endpoints that are exposed:
api/v1/me - This provides basic information for clients authenticating.
apiv/v1/verify - This allows services to ask if a specific token/user id is legit. All services implement middleware that does this automagically.

The Client
----------

[https://github.com/patricksrobertson/identity_client](https://github.com/patricksrobertson/identity_client)

I mention two libraries here. I wrote an [Omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) Client extension based upon the provider I wrote. Then I created a Rails Engine that we can mount inside applicaitons that want to authenticate with the ICIS Identity provider. It has a user object, stores things in the session, and has all the data a client app needs to inject to services later on.

The App
------

I chose to use [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) for the rich client because it's been getting a lot of buzz and we're considering future applications with it. This ended up being a pretty solid choice because modifying Ember to handle talking to a bunch of different services and passing custom headers in was pretty damn simple.

The Services
------------

[https://github.com/patricksrobertson/icis-patient-ex](https://github.com/patricksrobertson/icis-patient-ex)

[https://github.com/patricksrobertson/icis-user-ex](https://github.com/patricksrobertson/icis-user-ex)

These are [Rails-API](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api) apps that provide JSON API endpoints to the Ember.js application. They authenticate with the OAuth provider with Rack Middleware.

The Middleware
--------------

[https://github.com/patricksrobertson/rack-icis_identity_auth](https://github.com/patricksrobertson/rack-icis_identity_auth)

This middleware snags the custom headers sent by the Ember.js application and then makes a request to the OAuth provider to confirm that they are in fact legit. I'm personally debating as to whether or not this should be Middleware or if it should be a Rails engine. 

In reality, we'll need to persist some sort of 'Access Grant' that tells the middleware that we don't need to make a request to the OAuth provider. It should time out somewhat frequently, but keep us from DDoS'ing our own service. It will also need to paramaterize either a whitelist/blacklist of the API endpoints it is protecting. As it stands, it protects everything.

These things would be easier to accomplish for Rails/Rails-API based apps with an engine and before_filters. If we kept the architecture as Rack Middleware we are free to implement API endpoints in any RACK based framework.
